# React Router Dom: Unhandled Route Navigation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router Dom, where navigating between routes can result in unhandled errors due to incorrect or missing route definitions.

The `App.js` file contains the faulty implementation.  The error occurs when a route is not properly defined or if there's a mismatch between the defined path and the actual navigation path.  This leads to the application crashing or displaying unexpected behavior.

The solution involves carefully checking the `Routes` component and confirming all navigation paths are defined and correctly handled.
